# DRUPAL-10-project
This project is a custom Drupal 10 module developed as part of the FOSSEE Web Development Screening Task. The module allows administrators to configure events and users to register for them via a dynamic form. All registrations are stored in custom database tables and email notifications are sent to both users and administrators.
